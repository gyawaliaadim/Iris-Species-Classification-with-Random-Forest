# 🚀 Iris Species Classification with Random Forest

Iris Species Classification using Random Forest

This project implements a supervised machine learning pipeline to classify iris flower species using a Random Forest classifier. The workflow covers data loading, train–test splitting, model training, prediction, and accuracy evaluation using the classic Iris dataset.

Built with NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn.

Ideal as a baseline classification project and a reference for understanding ensemble learning with Random Forests.
